***   The test written by the QA calls the browser class
***   The browser class inherits from both the selenium browser class and the flow class
***   The selenium browser class is responsible for creating the browser instance and then starting it
      This is done by using the following code in browser from line 57 by calling the init method of 
      selenium class.
      Then the start method is called which is basically a rewrite of the start method in selenium.
      from line 81 or so.
      This passes some arguments to the get_string function which is responsible for getting the session id
      of the browser session which is initialized
      result = self.get_string("getNewBrowserSession", args)
      This will get the session id and then pass it on to the sessionid field of the selenium instance
      
      This is the part which needs to be changed
***   The flow class supplies the URL and related params to the browser session which is opened by selenium

*** Option 1
   # Create a new instance of the Firefox driver
   driver = webdriver.Firefox()


   # go to the google home page
   driver.get("http://www.google.com")
   
   However, another way of doing is using the selenium backed web driver
*** Option 2
    driver = RemoteWebDriver(desired_capabilities = DesiredCapabilities.FIREFOX)
    selenium = DefaultSelenium('localhost', 4444', '*webdriver', 'http://www.google.com')
    selenium.start(driver = driver)
    This does not work anymore. This has to be rewritten as
    driver = webdriver.Remote(desired_capabilities = DesiredCapabilities.FIREFOX)
    selenium = selenium.selenium('localhost', 4444', '*webdriver', 'http://www.google.com')
    selenium.start(driver = driver)
    


** DONE Understand how selenium webdriver should be called in voltage
   CLOSED: [2012-07-31 Tue 11:44]
***  Option 2 seems to be a better way of doing the porting. However in the case of this, the problem is that it may need a selenium server. I am gonna try this today
     In order to achieve this, first need to make the changes in only one place
     Where the browser class inherits from the selenium browser class. Change this so that it will use web driver and see how it goes.
     First do not run the selenium server

     
     The first change has to be done in the __init__ method of browser class
     1) If you want to use web driver, then pass the browser argument as "*webdriver" when
	the super __init__ is called at line 57
     2) Then in the start method, add an additional item to the list "args" as follows
        driver  = Remote(desired_capabilities = webdriver.DesiredCapabilities.FIREFOX)
        id = driver.desired_capabilities['webdriver.remote.sessionid']
        args.append('webdriver.remote.sessionid=%s' % id)
	Remember that we cannot do the prescribed method directly since the start method of selenium has been rewritten in voltage
	apparently to add network traffic tracking capability
     That should do it!!	
	
	
** DONE Understand how get_page works in voltage and then 
   CLOSED: [2012-07-30 Mon 16:44]

   There is sadly no get_page function in voltage

** DONE Create a webdriver decorator for tests
   CLOSED: [2012-08-01 Wed 13:01]
*** DONE Create a normal decorator
    CLOSED: [2012-07-31 Tue 11:44]
    This is done. A decorator is a means to modify a function without making changes in the function itself. 
    Execute some code before and after the function.
*** DONE Revert all changes to code except the web driver code
    CLOSED: [2012-07-31 Tue 11:47] 
*** DONE Put these in a decorator function
    CLOSED: [2012-07-31 Tue 16:45]

    This cannot be done without making changes to the existing voltage code
    There are some local variables which are present in the functions which are creating the browser session. In order to access these variables, we will need to either modify the current functions 
    or create new function*
    
    Conclsion:This does not seem to be a good idea. There is a lot of internal variables which voltage and selenium uses.
    In order to add webdriver support, we will need to edit these variables and hence its not directly possible
    decorators.
    Better use alternate function which does this.
** DONE Use the web driver in an existing test
    CLOSED: [2012-07-31 Tue 16:45]
    Used it for the carRental tests in userapp and I am getting the errors for two main things
    namely 
** DONE 1)Issue:  click is not working for hidden elements
     CLOSED: [2012-08-01 Wed 11:01]
     Currently, one of the tests is facing the issue that the element which is being used for the testing is using an invisible element to interact with. 
     Issue: The test is giving an exception for element not found.

     Root Cause: The element referred to is hidden in the test page under execution. Used firebug 
     to do the debugging.
     Selenium Web Driver needs the element to be visible for the test to go through.
     Selenium RC did not enforce this constraint.
     
     Solution: There are two alternatives
     1) Rewrite the test which is actually the correct solution since a user wont be able to click a hidden element
	Surround the code with a try catch block.

     2) In case, this is a roadblocker then use some kind of javascript injection to make the 
	element visible for that particular moment. This is ugly and is not the write way to do the testing logically.
	This will be explored only if the above method is not pushed through.
     

** DONE 2) Issue: screenshot is not working
   CLOSED: [2012-08-01 Wed 17:35]
     Unable to take screenshot
     1. Issue: Capture screenshot is not well supported in the remote webdriver for python.
     
     2. Solutions: 
	1) There is a different method for taking screenshot. Use this to take the screenshot
	   for voltage.The main problem here will be that the current screenshot method returns the image as a base64
	   encoded string.However, the remote web driver returns the image as png.
	2) There is also another way by using the remote.webdriver module which has the get_screenshot_as_base64
	   function which can be used as a replacement
	 
       The second method seems more better as of now. This can be done today.

** DONE Analysis: browser start function has a new argument added.
   CLOSED: [2012-08-01 Wed 17:35]
    + With the new issue coming to light as to when start is being used by a test
    + independently of being called from the __init__ constructor, 
    + Hence, need to evaluate as to how to implement the web driver so that 
      tests can be ported by doing one just one change.
      
    + Both of the above functionalities do not seem to be working currently for web driver.

**TODO Analyse the differences between webdriver and selenium RC
** 1) Find elements is not well supported in the selenium backed web driver. 
   This means that the current way of finding elements is fundamentally different in web driver and selenium RC.
   Options:
   What are the differences
   1) Invisible elements cannot be interacted with
   2) Xpath does not work as needed
   3) Check how the CSS selectors work
   4) Check how the id works


Issue: how selenium RC finds elements is different from how selenium web driver finds elements
Analysis: In case of selenium RC, there is a generic method called find elements and then depending on whether you give xpath or you give css selector, the RC does the right thing

    Asked Newman and Paul Yi who had requested the change. They are not aware of people using the change.
**** TODO Grep for webdriver in entire voltage repository
     Did this and there is only a single set of tests which are using the webdriver_browser.However,
     there is no flow related to those tests in the voltage flow module.
     This maybe an issue during the move but it should not be so big of an issue
    
*** Move the changes from browser to webdriver and webdriver chromebrowser.
    CLOSED: [2012-08-13 Mon 14:14]
    The OOP way to do it and use new style classes while at it.
    1) Converted the browser local variable in the Browser class to a field. This wont work
    2) Call the desired capabilities logic first   
    3) The Method Resolution Order in python is fucked up. Need to reasses code
       before submitting
    4) Current, we do seem to be using new style class however this has to be confirmed
*** Modify the review request
    CLOSED: [2012-08-13 Mon 14:14]
    "" Text for the review request
    
    Changes to support webdriver. Also cleaned up the code in the browser module of voltage.
    The main changes are
    1) Removed a lot of unwanted comments
    2) Removed a blank class
       
       The changes will be invisible to the testing teams. I have added a use_webdriver flag which will be set by the function is_webdriver_enabled function. Depending on whether this flag is set or unset, voltage will user webdriver or the selenium rc.
       
       Note:
       There are two classes there called WebDriverChromeBrowser and a WebDriverBrowser class in there which I had tested to see if they work but I have not been able to get them to work. The next thing that I am going to move the code to those two classes. This will be more efficient and safe from what I understand. I would be interested in knowing peoples thoughts on this. I have done a grep on

       However, this is how I thought of as a Java programmer and it may not be how a pythonista does it.

       To explain:
       My changes do the following
       Class Test calls -> Browser class -> 
       Inside the browser for each function which is affected by this change, the following logic will run
       if the use_webdriver flag is true, use the web driver api else use the selenium rc.

       Another Java/OOP way to do this
    1) If use_webdriver is true, Test calls WebDriverClass or Test calls the SeleniumRC class. 
       SeleniumRC class only has the selenium RC logic while WebDriver class gets the new logic.

       Depending on how we decide we can do either.

    1) Test : /home/dsubramanian/dev/Voltage/proc_test/procurement_ui/purchase/build_validation/PROC_b111_Verify_the_order_totals.py
       Exception: ERROR,Element is not currently visible and so may not be interacted with
       This is also erroring out in selenium RC but its for seed data error and not the same error
       The issue is that the element is not visible to web driver and hence its not being clicked.
       Solution: Use the below javascript inject method to achieve this
    element1 = self.driver.find_element_by_css_selector(locator.split('=')[1].split('.')[1])
    ex_string = 'var a = document.getElementsByClassName("'+locator.split('=')[1].split('.')[1]+'"); a[0].style.visibility="visible";'
    element1.parent.execute_script(ex_string)

    Exception: Exception: ERROR,Element xpath(//div[contains(@class,'m-productSeller')])[1]/text() not found
    This is successful in selenium RC
    
    This is a bigger issue currently since the xpaths used in the selenium rc were returning texts and elements while
    in case of webdriver, it only allows to return an element on the html page.
    
    The next step is to look at the file in dev/python-scripts/xpathtest.py to see the ways in which we can exploit 
    the xpath of voltage to give this functionality
