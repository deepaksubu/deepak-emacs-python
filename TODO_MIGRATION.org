  Requirements
- Add test cases to test plans
  This will be a two part flow.
  In the first part, the user will be asked to enter the grimy details of the test plan.
  Once the user submits the form, we now take him to the place where he/she adds the test cases.
  Supposed the user is of the dashboard team who wants to add 20 test cases to a form
  ** Ability to add entire folders
  ** Ability to add single tests
  Indicate which test cases have been added to the test plan - gmail idea of showing a colored notification at the top
  No need to go to home

  Process
  First the user is presented with the test plan form. He adds the necessary data to the test plan form. 
  Present the user with a save button.
  Once the user clicks save, the test case is saved.
  
  Once the test case is saved, the user is now shown the addtest cases to the plan button.
  When the user clicks on this button, it goes to the next screen.
  The next screen consists of the folder tree on the left and the test cases list on the right
  Whenever the user clicks on any node of the folder tree, the node expands and the test cases under it are shown to the user
  Each test case has a select radio button on its left. At one time, multiple tests can be selected. 
  Once the user selects the tests, he can click on a button add to test plan between the path and the pagination which will add the test cases to the test plan
  and show a notification to the user saying that the test cases have been added to the test plan. There will also be an undo link
  There will also be a button besides the add which will add the entire folder to the plan
  Once the user is done, he wil go to review page.
  In the review page,
  on the left side, you can see the folder tree which has the folders.
  on the right side, you can those tests which are under the test plan for this particular
  folder.
  If he notices that something is wrong, he can click on modify plan and it will take him back to the previous
  page where he can do the test plan editing again

  

He then clicks button "Add Tests"

* TODO cleanup testplanviews
* TODO The QA needs flexibility in how to organize their testplans. For example, they need to view plans by teams or by releases
Create a release folder and an integration folder inside it
1) create testplans in them.
   Attach testplans to folders
   Now, report on hummer => postintegration
